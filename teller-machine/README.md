 Teller Machine in this exercise we will learn how to loop through an array of objects and how to manipulate those objects.

 Bellow is an object with three methods inside of it.

    use the information you learned from freecodecamp to  add  functionality

User stories

1. I can add a user to the list by passing in an object with a name and pin

2. I can deposit an amount by passing in an object with my pin and amount to deposit

3. I should see a message after a deposit saying "N(amount) has been to deposited to my account(username)"

4. I can withdraw from an account by passing in a pin and an amount to withdraw

5. I should see a message after every successful withdrawal saying n amount has been credited from my account(username)

6. The user should not be allowed to withdraw an amount greater than the user's available balance instead the user should see

a message that says "Insufficient funds"

7. The user should not be allowed to deposit or withdraw if the pin is incorrect
